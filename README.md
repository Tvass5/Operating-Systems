# Operating-Systems

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?


The Gaming Room Client project is to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on the current game draw it or lose it, which is only available on android. The purpose of the game is to have multiple teams consisting of several people going four rounds at a minute each. When a picture is pulled from a library of images one team guesses till time runs out. If not answered each opposing team member gets to answer till 15 seconds run out.


# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this documentation, I did a particularly good job of evaluating the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of varying operating platforms.


# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most helpful part of the design document was the UML diagram, this gave me a clear picture of how my code needed to be structured.


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

If I could choose one part of my work to revise I would choose my recommendations. I believe that I could have been more in-depth and thorough with my recommendations, especially in the area of storage management and security.


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing so that you can have a clear idea of the time frame and budget needed to complete the project. I interpreted the user’s needs as must run on multiple platforms, each team should have multiple players and only one instance of the game can exist at any time.


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software by reading through the client's software requirements and gaining an understanding of what they wanted. I then created the UML diagram in order to get a visualization of the design of the software and then I proceeded from there. In the future, I intend to continue using UML diagrams to design software applications.
